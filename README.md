### 🔢 Array List
This project features a custom implementation of an `ArrayList` using standard arrays. By building an array list from scratch, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how dynamic arrays work under the hood, including resizing and memory management. It also includes a test class to validate the functionality of the custom list.

### 💬 Chat Room
Learn the basics of Java networking with this chat room project. It demonstrates how to set up a **server-client architecture** that allows multiple clients to connect and chat in real time. This is a great introduction to:
- Multi-threading 🧵
- Socket programming 🔌
- Network communication 🌐

---

### 🎨 JavaFX
This folder showcases the basics of **JavaFX**, Java’s GUI toolkit for creating modern desktop applications. You'll learn:
- Drawing shapes (rectangles, circles, etc.) 🟦
- Handling basic graphical events 🖱️
- Creating interactive and visually appealing interfaces 🎭

---

### 🎲 Monte Carlo Simulations
Explore the power of randomness with Monte Carlo simulations. These projects help estimate probabilities through repeated random sampling, a technique widely used in:
- Finance 📈
- Physics ⚛️
- Artificial intelligence 🤖

---

### 🏦 Mortgage Server
A client-server application that reimagines the classic mortgage calculator. Here's how it works:
1. The client sends mortgage data to the server.
2. The server applies the mortgage formula.
3. The result is sent back to the client.

This project reinforces:
- Client-server communication 🌐
- Serialization 📦
- Network programming concepts ⚡

---

### 🔄 Queue (Linked List Implementation)
Dive into data structures by implementing a `Queue` using linked lists. This project will help you master:
- Enqueue and dequeue operations ➡️⬅️
- Managing dynamic memory 💾
- Understanding pointers in Java 🔗

---

### ✂️ String Manipulation
A series of exercises focusing on string operations. Learn to:
- Reverse strings 🔄
- Format text 📏
- Perform pattern matching 🔍

---

### 📖 Word Dictionary
A simple dictionary application that demonstrates:
- Class creation and object-oriented principles 🔧
- Storing words and their definitions 📘
- Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 📝
